Manages the laser used for LIBS. Reads status/error codes from laser and handles initialization and arming.

Random Notes:
1. Laser Enable â€“ "This enables the laser and readies it for firing. Note: there will be an 8
second delay between when the laser is first enabled and the laser is able to fire." uJewel manual

3. Confirm power mode with Science team. Will power mode change with the uJewel modded to 13mJ from the base 8mJ?

4. Used ":member-order: bysource" in the .rst file for laserio to get Enums to sort by #. The global for :member-order must be alphabetical for CDH.

5. Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26534184/can-sphinx-ignore-certain-tags-in-python-docstrings to fix line wrapping in Sphinx's HTML talbes
