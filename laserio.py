laserio.py
Manages the laser used for LIBS. Reads status/error codes from laser and handles initialization and arming.

Task:
		This function can be expected to be continuously called until laser is warmed up.
Input: none
Output: Integer. 0 = laser warmed up, 1 = laser warming up, 2 = TLC warming module up, >2 = some sort of error.

Random Notes:
1) Laser Enable â€“ "This enables the laser and readies it for firing. Note: there will be an 8
second delay between when the laser is first enabled and the laser is able to fire." uJewel manual

2) Laser Status Bits:	Bit 15: Spare
						Bit 14: Spare
						Bit 13: High-Power Mode
						Bit 12: Low-Power Mode
						Bit 11: Ready To Fire				// Laser is enabled AND ready to fire. See note 1.
						Bit 10: Ready To Enable				// Proxy for laser is warmed up? Laser is warmed up and therefore CAN be enabled (armed/disarmed).
						Bit	 9: Power Failure (uhh boss, how do you tell me you've had a power failure when you don't have the power to respond? USB Power?)
						Bit	 8: Electrical Over Temp
						Bit	 7: Resonator Over Temp
						Bit	 6: External Interlock			// Not used?
						Bit	 5: Reserved
						Bit	 4: Reserved
						Bit	 3: Diode External Trigger
						Bit	 2: Reserved
						Bit	 1: Laser Active				// Laser is firing
						Bit	 0: Laser Enabled				// "laser is ready to fire". Armed/Disarmed state.

^^^This will be converted to a Sphinx table after I learn how to do that^^^

3) Confirm power mode with Science team
